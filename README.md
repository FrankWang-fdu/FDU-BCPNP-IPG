## 2024-03-21 请愿活动纪要

跟大家 update 一下今天上午跟 Mr. Jobin Mojtabavi 的沟通情况：

本次请愿一共征集到 202 位同学参与，现场到位的同学也很多。首先要感谢大家的支持和声援，也感谢 Mr. Jobin Mojtabavi 老师能坐下来，面对面倾听我们学生的声音。

### Frank 和几位同学代表跟 Mr. Jobin Mojtabavi 老师 在 lounge 大厅沟通，把微信在读大群里提到的所有诉求都明确地表达了，包括不限于：

1. 希望学校高层能代表学生向 BC gov 相关部门表达诉求，为 current & incoming student 争取利益， 影响新政的细则。
2. 要求取消选课限制，尽可能多地在 2024 summer 和 2024 fall 增开课程。
3. 要求延长 2024 Summer 选课截止时间，确保 2024 Summer 能增开课程。
4. 要求降低选择 capstone 对已修课程数量的要求，并且 capstone 不占用选课数量限额。
5. 要求提前 2024 fall 提前开学，并在 12 月之前尽早发放毕业信。
6. 要求三个方向可以混合选课。
7. 建议参考其他北美高校，增开 1 个学期的 summer semester 数目，缩短 spring break 和 summer break 时间。

### 本次活动达到了我们的既定基本目标：

1.  Mr. Jobin Mojtabavi 明确地收到了我们的请愿书，并当面倾听和记录了我们的所有诉求，并会及时转达给校长和其他相关部门的负责人。
2.  Mr. Jobin Mojtabavi 答应有任何 update 信息及时跟学生代表 Frank 沟通，并建立公开透明沟通渠道给所有受影响的学生，比如 zoom 会议。
3.  Mr. Jobin Mojtabavi 表示 2024 Summer 入学的同学近期会收到学校新政相关的通知邮件。

### 后续成果：

1. 学校已发邮件将于下周三 3 月 27 日下午三点 举行 Town Hall Meeting，邀请 Ministry of Advanced Education and Future Skills 跟学生的沟通会议，in person and zoom.
2. 学校选课系统已经更新下学期选课时间，延后到 2024 年 4 月 7 日。

### 接下来与学校层面沟通的后续行动：

1. 我们已将所有同学的诉求表达了，请大家保持团结，也请大家停止给学校领导和老师们大量发送重复相关问题的邮件。重复邮件会影响学校工作人员正常办公，对学生正常的学习生活也有影响，也影响学生代表跟学校沟通。
2. 针对下周三的 town hall 与教育部门的沟通会议，现在向所有同学征集新政策对大家可能造成的影响，以及我们对这个新政的未来细则的可能的建议。
3. 尽可能多地告知身边一起上课的其他族裔的同学，让所有收到新政策影响的同学都能加入周三的沟通会议。能来线下参加的，建议都来学校，气势上不能输。
4. 同时，向所有在读同学征集意见。集思广益学校可能会提出来哪些困难或借口，对应地我们可以提供哪些方面的协助或反驳，提前做好下一步的应对。

## Minutes of the Petition Activity on March 21, 2024

### Update on the Communication with Mr. Jobin Mojtabavi:

Today, a total of 202 students participated in the petition, and many students were present on-site.

Frank and several students represented the students in communicating with Mr. Jobin Mojtabavi in the lounge, clearly expressing all the demands mentioned in the WeChat group of students, including but not limited to:

- Requesting the school's leadership to represent the students to express demands to the relevant departments of the BC government, advocating for the interests of current and incoming students, and influencing the details of the new policy.
- Requesting the removal of course selection restrictions and the possible increase of courses in Summer 2024 and Fall 2024.
- Requesting an extension of the course selection deadline for 2024 Summer to ensure the addition of courses.
- Requesting a reduction in the number of courses required for Capstone and that Capstone does not count towards the course selection limit.
- Requesting an early start to the 2024 Fall term and the early issuance of graduation letters/completion letters/academic transcripts before December.
- Requesting the ability to choose a mix of elective courses between Advanced Computer Programming Specialization, Database Administration Specialization, and Other Electives Specialization as some electives may not be available in the Summer or Fall term.
- Suggesting to refer to other North American universities to increase the number of courses in the summer semester by one semester, and to shorten the spring break and summer break.

### The event achieved our established basic goals:

- Mr. Jobin Mojtabavi clearly received our petition and listened to and recorded all our demands in person, and promised to convey them to the president and other relevant department heads in a timely manner.

- Mr. Jobin Mojtabavi promised to communicate any updated information to student representative Frank promptly and establish an open and transparent communication channel for all affected students, such as a Zoom meeting.

- Mr. Jobin Mojtabavi stated that students entering the 2024 Summer will receive a notification email regarding the school's new policy soon.

### Subsequent achievements:

- The school's course selection system has been updated, and the course selection deadline for the next semester has been postponed to April 7, 2024.

### Subsequent actions communication within the school:

- We have expressed all students' demands. Please stay united, and please stop sending a large number of emails with repeated questions to school leaders and teachers. Repeated emails will affect the normal work of school staff, as well as students' normal study and life, and also affect student representatives' communication with the school.

- Regarding the town hall meeting and communication meeting with the Ministry of Education next Wednesday, we are now collecting feedback from all students on the possible impacts of the new policy and our possible suggestions for the future details of this new policy.

- As much as possible, inform other students of different ethnicities who are also taking classes together, so that all students affected by the new policy can join the communication meeting on Wednesday. For those who can come offline, it is suggested to come to the school. We cannot lose in terms of momentum.

- At the same time, we are collecting opinions from all students. Brainstorming what difficulties or excuses the school may propose, we can provide assistance or counterarguments accordingly, and prepare for the next steps in advance.
